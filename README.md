# ZurichR
Some code concerning the Zurich R User Meetup

### Instructions for name tags:

- Replace `"participants.csv"` by the list of participants from the meetup webpage
- If necessary adapt command `\ticketNumbers{2}{7}` to change the number of name tags per sheet.
- Replace `logo.png` by your desired logo.
- Compile PDF using knitr.
- Optional: Get annoyed by unforeseen weird special characters which break the code. Try to find and replace them (tip: two subsequent special characters seem to pose a problem).
- Print.
